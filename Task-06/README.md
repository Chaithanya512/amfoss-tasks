 I refered this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQlA2p--oEg) which made 80% of my task done. I encountered an error while doing the rest 20%, seemed like No MediaQuery widget ancestor found after surfing for some time, I got to know that MaterialApp() widget is missing in my code but I used the contents of that widget, headed to demo repo provided to us, saw the implementation and excuted it. And I agree, I designed something which is a bit different from the one provided to us. I don't know how to make that background color all over the page, I used container, so it is the output.
