# INTROSPECTION
## Why must you choose me?

I think i got to know about the Amfoss after my 12th class searching for good engineering colleges on quora.It was really interesting..it is when i decided to join Foss(though no one mentioned about selection process and tasks ðŸ˜‚). During the pandemic, i found myself interested in indulging with my pc and this kinda interest drove me to choose this club. Amfoss is the right place to endevour my skills with joy.Learning new stuff has always been challenging and exciting to me just like now..writing this intro at 11:30 in the night doesn't make me think of time because i am interested and excited in doing this ðŸ˜‡. There is a beginning for everything and this is the beginning to me,a rock-solid beginning i would say...making me think in different ways,to work efficiently,to work hard and i know **hardwork always pays**.   

## My plan for next 6 months!

The main motto of the club **Learning To Learn** has got my attention very much. I would be incorporating that motto into my life. **Time management** is another thing i will definetly improve. Learning atleast a single language with the deepest knowledge in it. To be fact, I dont even know if i will be in college in the next six months,i just want to convey that being at home or at college will not decide the way i learn or practice. *learning a bit depth about all the amfoss tasks* is for sure in the next six months. 

## How would i contribute to the club?

well, The best thing i can do is mentoring my juniors the best way possible like i'm getting now. To say, for a man like me with no technical background knows what all it takes to do the tasks and enter the club. This makes me help out my juniors from the very beginning. well, i even mentor for the people with technical background..in the same way i will learn something from them. 

## Feedback about selection process.

This selection process is the finest to extract the interested people and to bring out the best in them along with good relations. Apart form doing tasks it examines the patience(especially mine),ability to copeup with the multi-tasks(talking about academics),smart thinking.
