# INTROSPECTION
## Why must you choose me?

I think i got to know about the Amfoss after my 12th class searching for good engineering colleges on quora.It was really interesting..it is when i decided to join Foss(though no one mentioned about selection process and tasks ðŸ˜‚). During the pandemic, i found myself interested in indulging with my pc and this kinda interest drove me to choose this club. Amfoss is the right place to endevour my skills with joy.Learning new stuff has always been challenging and exciting to me just like now..writing this intro at 11:30 in the night doesn't make me think of time because i am interested and excited in doing this ðŸ˜‡. I also dance a bit, i guess foss doesnt want to miss that little entertainment in the club ðŸ˜‚.

## My plan for next 6 months!

The main motto of the club **Learning To Learn** has got my attention very much. I would be incorporating that motto into my life. **Time management** is another thing i will definetly improve. Learning atleast a single language with the deepest knowledge in it. And Whatever i do..i will do it with my fullest effort to excel in it(for the rest of my life).

## How would i contribute to the club?

well, The best thing i can do is mentoring my juniors the best way possible like i'm getting now.

## Feedback about selection process.

This selection process is the finest to extract the interested people and to bring out the best in them along with good relations.
